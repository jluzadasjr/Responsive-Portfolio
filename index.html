                    <p> My name is Jesus (also known as JR) and I am from Vacaville, CA. I am currently working as an IT Network Operations Analyst at PG&E for the past 4+ years. 
                            In my current at PG&E, my primary focus is in IT Change Management. When there are technicians who need to perform maintenance
                            or complete projects, I help determine business impacts and ensure other lines of businesses within the company have approved the work. 
                    
                          <br>
                          I enjoy hanging out with family/friends, traveling, and watching/playing sports. I am really excited to learn coding because I want to be able to help my current department
                  and hopefully move into a developer role. After working in IT for 5 years, it has really opened up many opportunites to learn new skills. I am so excited to embark on these new challenges
                  and hope to become a subject matter expert in the future.
